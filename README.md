# GWG-FEND-Nanodegree

## Introduction

In January 2018 I was accepted into Udacity's Grow With Google Challenge
Scholarship. 15K scholarships were awarded out of 100K applicants. This
provides a three month scholarship to the Front-End Web Developer track and the
top 1,500 participants who complete this program will be offered a free six
month scholarship for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

In April 2018 I won one of the approximately 1,500 slots in the Grow With
Google Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This Nanodegree is
a six-month course of studdy designed to equip the aspiring web developer with
the skills necessary to seek a postition as a Junior Web Developer. 

This repo contains my solutions to the Nanodegree coursework. If you have also
been awarded this opportunity then Congratulations! However, please abide by
Udacity's guidelines regarding original work.
